\section{Conclusions}

As a proof-of-concept experiment,
we were able to deduce the transmission of
a quantum mechanical particle through a 
ring resonator using finite elements.  

Future improvements could include
testing various geometries or input 
conditions, as well as improving the 
nonreflecting condition on the output boundaries.
According to \cite{better-boundary}, 
an optimal non-reflecting boundary will involve 
implementing a fractional time 
derivative on the boundary.
